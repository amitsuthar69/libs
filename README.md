## Implementing few libraries for practice

### Ready to use:

- [lrucache](https://github.com/amitsuthar69/libs/blob/master/lrucache) : A simple in-memory key-value cache with least recently used cache eviction policy.

- [wpool](https://github.com/amitsuthar69/libs/blob/master/wpool) : A simple worker pool.
